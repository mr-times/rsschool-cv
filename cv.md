## **Codewars example**
KATA from CODEWARS: Each day a plant is growing by upSpeed meters. Each night .that plant's height decreases by downSpeed meters due to the lack of sun heat. .Initially, plant is 0 meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning of a day. .We want to know when the height of the plant will reach a certain level.
```
function growingPlant(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight) {
  //coding and coding..
  let currentHeight = 0;
  let day = 1;
  while (currentHeight < desiredHeight){
    currentHeight += upSpeed;
    if (currentHeight < desiredHeight){
     currentHeight -= downSpeed;
     day += 1;
    }
  }
  return day
}
